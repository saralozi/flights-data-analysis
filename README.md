# ✈️ Flights Dataset — Data Exploration & Visualization

## Introduction
This project explores the classic Flights dataset to analyze passenger trends between 1949 and 1960.  
The analysis focuses on understanding long-term growth, seasonal patterns, and year-over-year changes through visual and statistical exploration.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure of the dataset  
- Analyze trends and seasonal patterns  
- Compute annual growth metrics  
- Visualize insights clearly and effectively  
- Summarize key findings from the data  

## What We Learned — Key Insights

### 1. Steady Long-Term Growth  
Passenger numbers increased consistently throughout 1949–1960, showing the rapid expansion of commercial aviation.

### 2. Strong Seasonal Patterns  
Summer months always had the highest passenger counts, while winter months showed the lowest.

### 3. Year-over-Year Growth Was Systematic  
Growth metrics and trend lines confirmed a clear upward trajectory, not random fluctuations.

### 4. Seasonal Variability + Trend Explain the Full Story  
Month-to-month variability combined with multi-year growth offers a complete picture of air-travel demand during this period.
